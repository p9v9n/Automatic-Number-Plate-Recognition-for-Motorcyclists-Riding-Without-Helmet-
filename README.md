Automatic Number Plate Recognition for  Motorcyclists Riding Without Helmet 
In current situation, we come across various problems in traffic regulations in India which can be solved with different ideas. Riding motorcycle/mopeds without wearing helmet is a traffic violation which has resulted in increase in number of accidents and deaths in India. Existing system monitors the traffic violations primarily through CCTV recordings, where the traffic police have to look into the frame where the traffic violation is happening, zoom into the license plate in case rider is not wearing helmet. But this requires lot of manpower and time as the traffic violations frequently and the number of people using motorcycles is increasing day-by-day. 
What if there is a system, which would automatically look for traffic violation of not wearing helmet while riding motorcycle/moped and if so, would automatically extract the vehicles' license plate number.
